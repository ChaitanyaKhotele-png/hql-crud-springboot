# HQL CRUD with Spring Boot

This is a Spring Boot application that performs **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using **Hibernate Query Language (HQL)** with a **MySQL database**. The project demonstrates how to interact with the database without using Spring Data JPA's repository interface — instead, we manually handle HQL-based operations via a DAO layer.
